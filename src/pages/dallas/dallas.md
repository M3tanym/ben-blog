# Transit in Dallas üèôÔ∏è

The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is the 4th largest [MSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Statistical_Area) in the United States.
You think about Dallas being "big", but this ranking really puts it in perspective -- 
it literally contains more than twice as many people than the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area (which feels large itself!)

Dallas also contains one of the most car-centric infrastructures in the US. 
The scale of the state and inter- state highway systems is staggering. 
Numerous over- and under-passes each consume as much area as a city neighborhood, yet serve only to funnel traffic on and off of the highway systems. At first glance this lack of urban density seems appalling, not least because of its aesthetic unappealing. However, the normal arguments for transit and urban density don't apply as well as you might expect. Of all areas in the US, Texas certainly has the most suitable landscape for car-centric infrastructure design. Its mostly flat, barren land is extremely well suited to interstate construction, and its temperate climate means roads last longer with less maintenance (compared to some areas, anyway...)

In addition to highways, Dallas also has a somewhat extensive _(that's generous)_ light rail network. 
It consists of four lines (Orange, Green, Red, Blue), all of which serve a central corridor of the Downtown Dallas area before branching out to different regions. The rail system connects both DFW area airports: Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL), and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). The connection to Love field is unfortunately not directly integrated with the airport, instead requiring the use of a shuttle between the Green Line stop and the airport terminal. However, service is frequent _(more so than some systems, at least)_ on most lines and the trains run with reasonable hours and reliability. 

These lines see relatively low ridership, however. I imagine this is because much of the city is just not walkable enough --
even if the light rail gets you within half a mile of your destination, walking in Dallas is much more difficult than in other cities.

It is encouraging to see how much housing has been developed along the light rail lines, though. The Green line in particular sees dozens
of large, modern apartment complexes as it leaves the downtown area, serving areas that gradually become much more industrial and car-centric.

Living in rail-adjacent housing seems like a pretty reasonable proposition for someone who works in Dallas. However, living even a 10-minute drive from the rail line
wholly eliminates its usefulness. Credit where credit is due: even from far away, you can drive to the Dallas downtown
area and park in less than 30 minutes, which is absolutely not true for many metro areas, Denver and Minneapolis included.

The DART (Dallas Area Regional Transit) authority considered a subway section for its rail lines for about 10 years (2008-2023)
before indefinitely postponing the project, likely due to financial constraints and low ridership.
This didn't actually make tons of sense to me -- the downtown area is so well integrated with the rail stations that a subway
would probably not add that much value (not $2 billion of value, at least).

Personally, I am actually pleasantly surprised by the DART system -- I would have expected such a historically conservative state
to invest only in car infrastructure.
